We have used the playground to classify. For example try the following.
GPT-3 can classify items into categories. Use the file on the left to write your prompts. Try the prompt below:
```markdown
classify the following : cat, dog , car , plane
```

{Try it!}(python3 box.py 5)

{Reset}(python3 reset.py 5)
 
We are going to create our own playground to try and run the following 5 tasks.

1. Use GPT-3 to generate natural language text for a given topic. This can be used to quickly generate blog posts, essays, and other forms of copy.

2. Utilize GPT-3 to generate product descriptions, titles and other marketing materials.

3. Use GPT-3 to automate customer support tasks such as FAQs and customer service emails.

4. Leverage GPT-3 to generate technical documentation and software manuals.

5. Automate the process of summarizing long articles with GPT-3.

We will get to all of that but first we want to create a text file that is able to do what the playground on our left can do. Again on the idea of creating a more user-friendly program. 

Let's ask the box to:
```
generate a blog post about a pizza shop
```
{Try it!}(python3 box.py 9)
{Reset}(python3 reset.py 9)

Our goal in this lesson is to recreate the box. The user should be able to write whatever they want and that should be passed on as the prompt. After that the generated answer will also be placed in your file.
